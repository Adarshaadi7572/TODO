## Running React with Tailwind CSS on [Repl.it](https://replit.com)

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) is a very popular open source CSS framework that provide utility classes so that you won't have to leave your HTML or Javscript work.

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a blazing fast frontend build tool that includes features like Hot Module Reloading (HMR), optimized builds, and TypeScript support out of the box.

Using the React with vite is one of the fastest ways to build a web app.
And with Tailwind CSS, you can create a very beautiful looking websites.

### Getting Started
- Hit run
- Edit [App.jsx](#src/App.jsx) and watch it live update!

By default, Replit runs the `dev` script, but you can configure it by changing the `run` field in the [configuration file](#.replit). Here are the vite docs for [serving production websites](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html)

### Typescript

Just rename any file from `.jsx` to `.tsx`. You can also try our [TypeScript Template](https://replit.com/@replit/React-TypeScript)

### Tailwind CSS

For styling with Tailwind CSS, just add the utility classes to the particular element. Make sure to use the `className` attribute. Check out the [Tailwind CSS Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) for more information.

### Setting Up and Running in VS Code --->
### Install Dependencies:->
  Open the integrated terminal in VS Code (View > Terminal or Ctrl+ `) and run npm install` to install the necessary dependencies for 
  your React project.
  
### Start the Development Server:->
 After the dependencies are installed, run npm start in the terminal. This will start the React development server.
 Once the server starts, you should see a message indicating the local address (usually localhost:3000) where your React app is running.
 Open in Browser:

 Open a web browser and navigate to localhost:3000 (or whichever address is indicated in the terminal) to view your React application 
 running locally.
